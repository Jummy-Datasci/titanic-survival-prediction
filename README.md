# Titanic Survival Prediction
This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger would survive the disaster based on their features.

## project Objective

To demonstrate skills in:
 - Data cleaning and preprocessing
 - Exploratory data Analysis (EDA)
 - Visualization
 - Feature engineering
 - Building and evaluating a machine learning model

   ## Dataset
   The [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) is one of the most famous datasets in data science and machine learning, ideal for praticing classification problems.
   
  ## Tools & Libraries:
  - Python
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
(RandomForestClassifier)

##  Project Workflow

1.  Data Exploration
   - Checked for missing values
   - Analyzed survival patterns based on gender, class, and age
   - Visualized distributions and trends
     
2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handled missing values
   - Dropped irrelevant features ('Name','Ticket','Cabin')
   - Converted categorical variables to numerical
     
3.  Model Building
     -Split dataset into training and test sets
     - Trained a Random Forest Classifier
     - Evaluated model performance
       
4.  Prediction
    - Made predictions on new (unseen) passenger data
      
## outcome
- Achieved strong model performance on the test set
- Successfully predicted survival using classification
